abstract = {Summary
Terrestrial organisms developed circadian rhythms for adaptation to Earthâ€™s quasi-24-h rotation. Achieving precise rhythms requires diurnal oscillation of fundamental biological processes, such as rhythmic shifts in the cellular translational landscape; however, regulatory mechanisms underlying rhythmic translation remain elusive. Here, we identified mammalian ATXN2 and ATXN2L as cooperating master regulators of rhythmic translation, through oscillating phase separation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus along circadian cycles. The spatiotemporal oscillating condensates facilitate sequential initiation of multiple cycling processes, from mRNA processing to protein translation, for selective genes including core clock genes. Depleting ATXN2 or 2L induces opposite alterations to the circadian period, whereas the absence of both disrupts translational activation cycles and weakens circadian rhythmicity in mice. Such cellular defect can be rescued by wild type, but not phase-separation-defective ATXN2. Together, we revealed that oscillating translation is regulated by spatiotemporal condensation of two master regulators to achieve precise circadian rhythm in mammals.},

	abstract = {Recent spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have enabled sub-single-cell resolution profiling of gene expression across the whole transcriptome. However, the transition to high-definition ST significantly increased sparsity and dimensionality, posing computational challenges in discerning cell identities, understanding neighborhood structure, and identifying differential expression - all are crucial steps to study normal and disease ST samples. Here we present STHD, a novel machine learning method for probabilistic cell typing of single spots in whole-transcriptome, high-resolution ST data. Unlike current binning-aggregation-deconvolution strategy, STHD directly models gene expression at single-spot level to infer cell type identities. It addresses sparsity by modeling count statistics, incorporating neighbor similarities, and leveraging reference single-cell RNA-seq data. We demonstrated that STHD accurately predicts cell type identities at single-spot level, which automatically achieved precise segmentation of global tissue architecture and local multicellular neighborhoods. The STHD labels facilitated various downstream analyses, including cell type-stratified bin aggregation, spatial compositional comparison, and cell type-specific differential expression analyses. These high-resolution labels further defined frontlines of inter-cell type interactions, revealing direct cell-cell communication activities at immune hubs of a colon cancer sample. Overall, computational modeling of high-resolution spots with STHD uncovers precise spatial organization and deeper biological insights for disease mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract      = "The fields of therapeutic application and drug research and
                   development (R\&D) both face substantial challenges, i.e.,
                   the therapeutic domain calls for more treatment
                   alternatives, while numerous promising pre-clinical drugs
                   have failed in clinical trials. One of the reasons is the
                   inadequacy of Cross-drug Response Evaluation (CRE) during
                   the late stages of drug R\&D. Although in-silico CRE models
                   bring a promising solution, existing methodologies are
                   restricted to early stages of drug R\&D, such as target and
                   cell-line levels, offering limited improvement to clinical
                   success rates. Herein, we introduce DeepCRE, a pioneering AI
                   model designed to predict CRE effectively in the late stages
                   of drug R\&D. DeepCRE outperforms the existing best models
                   by achieving an average performance improvement of 17.7\% in
                   patient-level CRE, and a 5-fold increase in indication-level
                   CRE, facilitating more accurate personalized treatment
                   predictions and better pharmaceutical value assessment for
                   indications, respectively. Furthermore, DeepCRE has
                   identified a set of six drug candidates that show
                   significantly greater effectiveness than a comparator set of
                   two approved drugs in 5/8 colorectal cancer organoids. This
                   demonstrates the capability of DeepCRE to systematically
                   uncover a spectrum of drug candidates with enhanced
                   therapeutic effects, highlighting its potential to transform
                   drug R\&D.",
