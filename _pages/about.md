**Research**:

My name is Silas(Chuhanwen) Sun, and now I am a Biomedicine master student at Karolinska Institute, passionate about leveraging multi-omics to unravel the complexities of human diseases. With proficiency in R, Python, and Linux, and hands-on experience in informatics and wet-lab research, I am dedicated to employing data-driven methods to solve clinical problems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and improve treatment outcomes.


**Previous Experience**:

* Earned a Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under the guidance of [Dr. Yi Lin](http://linyi-lab.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/home/), focusing on "Investigation into pathophysiological roles of ATXN2/2L in neuron system."

* Expanded expertise from wet lab research to data-driven approaches by participating in the [Pre-clinical drug discovery project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03768) at [Air Tsinghua](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), focusing on diverse multi-omics datasets integration and tumor sub-clustering techniques refining.

* Further developed skills in single-cell analysis at the [Xuegong Zhang Lab](http://eca.xglab.tech/member/index.html) at Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, conducting scRNA-seq to identify cellular transformations related to atherosclerotic plaque instability.

* Explored new informatics directions and applied skills to tumor research by joining [Jean's Lab](https://www.hausserlab.org/) at Karolinska Institute [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/), engaging in tumor modeling using patient histological data and monitoring dynamics within the tumor microenvironment.

* Gained experience in spatial transcriptomics at [Yizhang's Lab](https://yi-zhang-compbio-lab.github.io/) at Duke University during the summer following the first master semester, contributing to the research in cell typing and publication of "STHD: probabilistic cell typing of single Spots in whole Transcriptome spatial data with High Definition" ([bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.20.599803v1)).
